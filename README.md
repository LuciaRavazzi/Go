This repo consists of a basic introduction to Go programming language.
Go was born in 2009 and designed by Google's employees. It's characterized by the velocity of C but the semplicity of python. 
It's a compiled language, which means that a compiler is required to trasform the code into a low-level language code, like assembly. 
Moeover, since it's a static type language, the variable's type must be defined. 

The main explained topics are the following:

<ol>
<li> Variables </li>  
<li> If, loops, switch </li>  
<li> Functions, structs, pointers, deferences </li>  
</ol>
  
The tutorial was explained by Tech With Tim, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg.
